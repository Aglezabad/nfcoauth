# NFCOAuth

This is a semester project for the CMU course [14-829 Mobile Security](http://mews.sv.cmu.edu/teaching/14829/f15/).

Team members are:

* @AmrutaGadgil
* @phoenixes
* Dhruvi Tyagi
* @jokr

This is by no means any production ready code but should only be used for inspiration. It is released to the public domain.

## Usage

The important folders are `OAuthDemo` which is a Android application demonstrating the client usage. The `server` is only a dummy backend that shows whether the authentication is successful or not. The other folders were only needed for experimentation, but remain in the repository.
